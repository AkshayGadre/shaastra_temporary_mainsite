                            <b>WHAT IS SHAASTRA?</b> <br />
                            Shaastra is innovating.<br />
                            New ideas come to the fore, new formats are born, boundaries are broken at Shaastra.<br />

                        Shaastra is the world of students. It is by the students, for the students and of the students. <br />
                        Shaastra is beyond science. It is born of science, it is inspired by science and driven by science, but not constrained by science.

                        Shaastra is everything that is new, and a little of the glorious past. <br />
                        "Only by standing on the shoulders of the giants can you see into the distance"...Isaac Newton
                        At Shaastra, we agree.

                        Shaastra is about transformation, rejuvenation and regeneration.<br />
                        Shaastra is about changing with the times. Constantly changing. It is about the courage to throw away the old, and make it new and important again.<br />
                        <br />
                        Shaastra is the pathway to everything thatâ€™s possible.<br />
                        And of making the impossible possible.<br />
                        <br />
                        Shaastra is about science and technology, learning and playing, inspiring and being inspired.<br />
                        <br />
                        Shaastra is about exploring, pushing the boundaries of that which is possible and embracing knowledge.<br />
                        <br />
                        This is Shaastra.<br />
                        <br />
